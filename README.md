Fast Prototype


# Features Include:  
Physics based movement and collisoins.  
Camera tracking with raycast collisions to reduce intersections on movement.  
Interaction between force-based movement and vector-based movement for fixed rotating platforms / moving platforms and a player object.  
Kill planes with respawn areas which change on pass-through.  
Material changes for increased friction, mass, drag, and elasticity.
